### A full-stack Python framework for creating interactive web applications from Jupyter Notebooks.

Experiments for serving Jupyter Notebook files through Tornado websockets as an interactive web application.

# How it works ü§∑üèΩ
#### (Streamlit + Jupyter Notebook) =:

- The client connects to the server through websocket.
- The server reads and compiles the Notebook's source code and executes it cell by cell.
- The Notebook's source code calls widget functions.
- The widgets are sent to the client through the server.
- The client displays the widgets as UI components.
- The client sends widget input to the server on user interactions.
- The server partially re-executes the Notebook with the new input.

- +1 Works embedded inside Jupyter without running a server using in-browser Javascript.

So it is basically Streamlit, but it
- does not rerun the whole script on inputs, only the given cells (imitating the normal data science flow: when I modify a cell, I rerun it with the following cells).
- can work without a server and display widgets inside the Notebook during development.

So it is better. üí©

# How to run üèÉüèΩ

_Currently only the dev mode is supported._

Prerequisites:
- Python >= 3.9 + PiP
- Node.js >= 18.0

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ./frontend
npm install
```

### Embedded mode from a Notebook:
Use an existing example or create a new Notebook:
```bash
cd ./examples
jupyter notebook
```

### Standalone server mode:
Start backend:
```bash
python ./main.py
```
Start frontend:
```bash
cd ./frontend
npm run dev
```
Then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Start widget storybook:
```bash
cd ./widget
npm run storybook
```
Then go to [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)
